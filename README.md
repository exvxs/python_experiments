# python_experiments
Trying this out, like I've got time during school to learn to code.
note to self to push:
    ```
    git init
    git add {file I want to add}
    git commit
    git remote add origin {https bullshit that's actually the location of the repo}
    git push origin master
    and bob's your uncle
    ```
